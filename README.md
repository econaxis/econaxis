- 👋 Hi, I’m @econaxis
- 👀 I’m interested in networking, databases, and graphics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning modulation techniques, signal processing
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any cool project
- 📫 How to reach me: email h99nguye at uwaterloo.ca

### Here are some of my projects:

[**JSON database**](https://github.com/econaxis/database) - A fully transactional, ACID database that can store infinite depth JSON objects

[**db1**](https://github.com/econaxis/db1) - A second iteration attempt to make a database. A simpler key-value database with static schema, fixed-size tuples, and columnar compression. Built for use by my search engine

[**Full-text search engine**](https://github.com/econaxis/search) - A full-text search engine (like Elasticsearch). Demo includes near-instant textual search of all English Wikibooks articles. Uses *db1* as the underlying storage engine

[**3d renderer**](https://github.com/econaxis/renderer) - An image buffer, triangle rasterizer, 3d renderer from scratch. Includes shadows, highlights, ambient lighting, and various performance optimizations. Compiled to WASM.

[**Transit map**](https://github.com/econaxis/transit) - 
Map visualization of 1000+ Toronto buses travelling in real-time. Uses WebGL and some performance optimizations to do 60FPS rendering of that many buses.

For a better video than the GIF, I have a [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/sEx_jOtT0IM)

[**Coroutines and garbage collector in C**](https://github.com/econaxis/coroutines) - 
Userspace context switching, multitasking without threads, or stackful, preemptive multitasking. Implemented with some small inline assembly and register manipulation. Made a fair task scheduler based off the Linux CFS scheduling algorithm.
Mark-and-sweep garbage collector in C. Implemented using `pycparser` to modify C code, and custom stack frames to find GC roots.
